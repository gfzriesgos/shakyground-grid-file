Shakyground Vs Grid
====================

Here we are going to update the global vs grid from the usgs with
some more local data for

1. Lima
1. Valpariso

You can run the makefile to download the grd file and run the updates
for Lima and Valparaiso on the fly.

However, you may need some python dependencies:

```
netCDF4==1.5.3
scipy==1.4.1
Rtree==0.8.3
geopandas==0.5.1
Shapely==1.6.4.post2
```

You can install each one with pip3.

```
pip3 install 'netCDF4==1.5.3'
```
